## Our Mission

The Nashville Blockchain Developers Network aims to bootstrap a strong grassroots movement within the Nashville Metropolitan Area. Giving guidance and providing resources for aspiring developers to create new applications on blockchain technologies.

We believe that these technologies are already creating a massive shift in the way we trust, govern, and verify. Teaching and creating together will give opportunities to those who want to build the decentralized future together. We want Nashville to be a hubspot for this paradigm shift, welcoming to the new makers that will push these technologies forward. 

Blockchain technologies, especially those focused around public use-cases are shaping up to be one of the most influential creations of the 21st century. We want to help guide aspiring developers on their journey with workshops, presentations, and tooling from industry leaders.
